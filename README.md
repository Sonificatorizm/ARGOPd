# ARGOPd

A collection of abstractions for Pure Data

ARGOPd is made of real-time sound and visual synthesis modules (MM) and patches (ExMM).

It runs on Pd Vanilla 0.47 or later.

It needs libraries, all available on Deken.

Most patches also work under Pd-0.43.4-extended

For MacOSX, Linux, Windows.

ARGOPd is for users who have never programmed with Pure Data.
